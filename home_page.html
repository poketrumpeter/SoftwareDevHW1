        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>
            My name is Gregorio Figueroa and I am currently a double major in Computer Science and Technology Arts
            and Media at CU Boulder. These majors go well together because they both approach what can be done with
            technology from different angles. TAM (Technology Arts and Media) presents technology in a more artistic
            and creative way, while Computer Science talks about some if the underlying function and working of
            technology and how to manipulate it. I am doing these majors because I am interested in technology and
            using computers to wither make things or accomplish tasks. I actually started as just a TAM major but after
            taking CSCI 1300, an into coding class for C++, I wanted to add the Computer Science major.

            An interesting fact about me is I am currently in AGO(Alpha Gamma Omega), a fraternity on campus. What is unique
            about AGO is that it is a faith based christian fraternity. I pledged last spring(2018) and became an active near
            the end of that semester. AGO has been such a cool and life-changing organization to be part of and I am thankful
            for all that has come of it. Another interesting fact about myself is that I work as a lifeguard and am able to teach
            swim lessons on the weekends. Finally one last interesting fact about me is that I also work at Starbucks on campus as
            a barista.
